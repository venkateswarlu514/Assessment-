Implementation Plan:

1. Development of Smart Contracts
   - Programming Language: Use Rust.
   - Framework: Utilize the DFINITY SDK (Canister SDK) for developing and deploying on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain.
   - Token Standards: Follow the IRCRC2 token standard to define the token's functionality.
   - Key Features: 
     - Token sending and receiving functionalities.
     - Implement wallet security features (e.g., checks for valid addresses, signature verification).
     - Functions to fetch and display token balances

2. Deployment:
   - Set up a local ICP testnet using the DFX CLI tool.
   - Deploy the compiled Wasm files for the smart contracts onto the local testnet.
3. Testing:
   - Write unit tests using the ICP framework (e.g., `motoko` or testing libraries in Rust).
   - Test all smart contract functions:
     - Send tokens: Verify tokens are sent correctly between valid addresses.
     - Receive tokens: Ensure the wallet updates token balances after receiving tokens.
     - Balance Display: Check the accuracy of balance retrieval.
4. Deliverables
Rust Code: Full implementation of the token wallet in Rust, adhering to the requirements.
Unit Tests: A suite of unit tests that validate the contract functions.
   - Documentation:
     - Setup instructions for deploying the smart contract.
     - Testing instructions.
   - GitHub Repository: Publish the code, tests, and documentation on GitHub.
5. Skills Required
Rust Programming: Advanced knowledge of Rust and its libraries.
   - ICP Blockchain:
     - Experience developing canisters (smart contracts) for the ICP.
     - Familiarity with tools like DFX CLI.
   - Security Practices:
     - Address validation.
     - Prevention of overflow/underflow during token transactions.
Timeline:
1. First 24 Hours:
   - Set up the development environment (install DFX CLI, Rust toolchain).
   - Start coding the basic functionality (e.g., creating the token, implementing send/receive functions).
   - Deploy a minimal working version to the local testnet.
   - Provide a progress report (share code snippets and deployment logs).

2. Second 24 Hours:
   - Implement balance display and wallet security measures
   - Write and run unit tests
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Finalize the GitHub repository and prepare the deliverables

Resources:
ICP Documentation: [DFINITY Developer Docs](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/)

IRCRC2 Token Standard: Review token standard specifications for implementation.
 Communication Channel: Set up a platform (e.g., Slack or Discord) for technical support

Evaluation Criteria
1. Functionality: Ensure all specified operations work flawlessly
2. Code Quality: Maintain clean, modular, and well-commented code.
3. Security: Address potential vulnerabilities and ensure safe transactions
4. Documentation: Provide clear setup, deployment, and testing guides
